**Project Context Summary**

**Goal:** Build a MERN stack application for a jewellery store, transforming it into a catalogue with categories and search functionality.

**Current State:**

*   **Backend:**
    *   `User`, `Product`, `Category`, and `Cart` models are implemented.
    *   API endpoints for authentication, products (CRUD), categories (CRUD), and cart operations are implemented.
    *   Admin user creation from `.env` is implemented.
    *   `productController.js` supports filtering by category and searching by name.
    *   Image encoding to base64 is handled on the backend.
*   **Frontend:**
    *   React application with `react-router-dom`, `axios`, `bootstrap`, `react-bootstrap`, `react-toastify`, and `jwt-decode`.
    *   Authentication context (`AuthContext`) and Cart context (`CartContext`) are implemented.
    *   `Header` component displays conditional links (Login/Signup modal or Logout) and cart item count.
    *   `Footer` component is sticky at the bottom.
    *   `HomePage` displays a hero section with a local image and a `CategoryList` component.
    *   `ProductsPage` displays products, supports filtering by category, has a search bar with a clear button, and an "Add to Cart" button.
    *   `ProductDetailPage` displays details of a single product.
    *   `CartPage` displays cart items with options to remove items.
    *   `AdminDashboardPage` allows for CRUD operations on products and categories, with separate tabs for each.
    *   `LoginSignupModal` handles user login and signup.
    *   `AdminRoute` protects the admin dashboard, redirecting to `AdminLoginPage` if not an authenticated admin.
    *   `AdminLoginPage` provides a dedicated login for admin users.

**Completed Tasks (since last major update):**

*   Implemented category management (CRUD) in the admin dashboard.
*   Implemented product CRUD in the admin dashboard.
*   Added `CategoryList` component to `HomePage`.
*   Implemented category filtering and search bar in `ProductsPage`.
*   Implemented `ProductDetailPage`.
*   Improved UI/UX for "catalogue" feel (styling, search clear button).
*   Fixed "RangeError" by handling image encoding on the backend.
*   Fixed "Add to Cart" functionality.
*   Fixed footer not being fixed at the bottom.

**Remaining Tasks:**

1.  **Further UI/UX improvements for a "catalogue" feel:**
    *   Review overall design and make further enhancements to visual appeal and user experience.
2.  **Product Detail Page Enhancements:**
    *   Ensure the product detail page has an image gallery (currently only a single image).
    *   Add quantity selection for "Add to Cart" on the product detail page.
3.  **Checkout Process:**
    *   Implement a more robust checkout process (beyond a simple alert). This would involve order creation on the backend and a dedicated checkout page on the frontend.
4.  **User Profile/Order History:**
    *   Implement a user profile page where users can view their order history.
