**Project Context Summary**

**Goal:** Build a MERN stack application for a jewellery store, transforming it into a catalogue with categories and search functionality.

**Current State:**

*   **Backend:**
    *   `User`, `Product`, `Category`, and `Cart` models are implemented.
    *   API endpoints for authentication, products (CRUD), categories (CRUD), and cart operations are implemented.
    *   Admin user creation from `.env` is handled.
    *   `productController.js` supports filtering by category and searching by name.
    *   Image encoding to base64 is managed on the backend.
    *   Backend `server.js` has been configured for Vercel serverless deployment (exports `app`, connects to MongoDB on request, `createAdmin` commented out).
    *   `vercel.json` is configured for Vercel deployment.
*   **Frontend:**
    *   React application with `react-router-dom`, `axios`, `bootstrap`, `react-bootstrap`, `react-toastify`, and `jwt-decode`.
    *   Authentication context (`AuthContext`) and Cart context (`CartContext`) are implemented.
    *   `Header` component displays conditional links (Login/Signup modal or Logout) and cart item count.
    *   `Footer` component is sticky at the bottom.
    *   `HomePage` displays a hero section with a local image and a `CategoryList` component.
    *   `ProductsPage` displays products, supports filtering by category, has a search bar with a clear button, and an "Add to Cart" button.
    *   `ProductDetailPage` displays details of a single product.
    *   `CartPage` displays cart items with options to remove items.
    *   `AdminDashboardPage` allows for CRUD operations on products and categories, with separate tabs for each.
    *   `LoginSignupModal` handles user login and signup.
    *   `AdminRoute` protects the admin dashboard, redirecting to `AdminLoginPage` if not an authenticated admin.
    *   `AdminLoginPage` provides a dedicated login for admin users.
    *   Frontend `package.json` proxy is set to `https://jewellery-store-catalogue-n81i.vercel.app` for Vercel backend.

**Completed Tasks (since last major update):**

*   Implemented category management (CRUD) in the admin dashboard.
*   Implemented product CRUD in the admin dashboard.
*   Added `CategoryList` component to `HomePage`.
*   Implemented category filtering and search bar in `ProductsPage`.
*   Implemented `ProductDetailPage`.
*   Improved UI/UX for "catalogue" feel (styling, search clear button).
*   Fixed "RangeError" by handling image encoding on the backend.
*   Fixed "Add to Cart" functionality.
*   Fixed footer not being fixed at the bottom.
*   Updated `deleteProduct` and `deleteCategory` to use `deleteOne()` in backend controllers.
*   Configured backend for Vercel deployment (`server.js` and `vercel.json`).
*   Created `frontend/src/services/api.js` for centralized API calls.
*   Updated `CategoryList.js`, `AdminDashboardPage.js`, `ProductsPage.js`, `ProductDetailPage.js`, `LoginSignupModal.js`, and `CartContext.js` to use the new `api` instance.
*   Added conditional rendering for `categories.map` in `CategoryList.js` to prevent `TypeError`.
*   **Fixed Admin Login Issues:**
    *   Modified `backend/server.js` to uncomment and integrate the `createAdmin` function, ensuring admin user creation on server startup.
    *   Added `app.listen()` for local server execution in `backend/server.js`.
    *   Explicitly set the `.env` file path in `dotenv.config()` in `backend/server.js` for robust environment variable loading.
    *   Corrected a typo in `createAdmin` from `process.env.NAME` to `process.env.ADMIN_NAME` in `backend/server.js`.
    *   Added detailed logging to the `login` function in `backend/controllers/authController.js` for debugging.
    *   Modified `frontend/src/pages/AdminLoginPage.js` to use the centralized `api` service and improved error handling.
    *   Commented out `REACT_APP_API_URL` in `frontend/.env` for local development.
*   **Fixed Mobile Navigation Toggle:**
    *   Refactored the `Header` component in `frontend/src/components/Header.js` to use `react-bootstrap` components for the navigation bar, resolving the mobile toggle issue.
    *   Fixed a `SyntaxError` (duplicate export) in `frontend/src/components/Header.js`.

**Remaining Tasks:**

1.  **Further UI/UX improvements for a "catalogue" feel:**
    *   Review overall design and make further enhancements to visual appeal and user experience.
2.  **Product Detail Page Enhancements:**
    *   Ensure the product detail page has an image gallery (currently only a single image).
    *   Add quantity selection for "Add to Cart" on the product detail page.
3.  **Checkout Process:**
    *   Implement a more robust checkout process (beyond a simple alert). This would involve order creation on the backend and a dedicated checkout page on the frontend.
4.  **User Profile/Order History:**
    *   Implement a user profile page where users can view their order history.
5.  **Vercel Deployment of Frontend:**
    *   Set `REACT_APP_API_URL` environment variable in Vercel frontend project settings to the deployed backend URL.
    *   Deploy the frontend to Vercel.
